An end-to-end **Machine Learning + Web Application** that predicts the likelihood of diabetes using health parameters such as **Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF), and Age**.  

The system is powered by a **Random Forest Classifier**, served via a **FastAPI backend**, and an interactive **React frontend**.

## 📖 Overview
This project provides a web-based tool for **early diabetes prediction**.  
The ML model was trained on the [kaggle_diabetics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set), achieving reliable performance for classification tasks.  

Users can input health metrics, and the system instantly returns a **Diabetic / Non-Diabetic prediction** along with a visual result display.

## 💡 Motivation
Diabetes is a global health concern, and early detection is critical.  
With the power of **Machine Learning**, we can assist in **early diagnosis** to prevent severe complications.  

This project was designed as a complete **end-to-end ML application**: from model training to deployment-ready web tool.
